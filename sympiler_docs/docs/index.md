Sympiler is a domain-specific code generator that optimizes sparse matrix computations by decoupling the symbolic analysis phase from the numerical manipulation stage in sparse codes. Sympiler then generates specialized code based on the symbolic information. The following figure shows how the input code to Sympiler is transformed internally to an optimized code.
