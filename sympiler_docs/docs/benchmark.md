To evaluate the performance of the Sympiler's generated code and compare it 
with other libraries and code generators, we created a benchmarks. 
The Sympiler benchmark compares the performance sparse BLAS kernels generated 
by Sympiler with other libraries. 


## Sympiler benchmark
Sympiler benchmark is available from [here](https://github.com/sympiler/sympiler-bench) 
and contains scripts and drivers to compare Sympiler with libraries 
such as MKL and Suitesparse for Cholesky factorization and sparse triangular solver.
